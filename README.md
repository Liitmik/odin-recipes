Project: Recipes - Create a recipe page to showcase basic HTML.

# Thoughts
This was first assignment with Odin Project curriculum. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images and links. Created ordered and unordered lists for my recipes.

# Tech used
Build with HTML.
