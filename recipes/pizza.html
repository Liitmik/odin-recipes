        <h2>Pizza crust Ingredients</h2>

        <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-make-pizza-dough/" target="_blank">pizza crust.</a></p>

        <strong>Yeast</strong>
        <p>Active dry yeast is a leaving agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes</p>
        <p>the pizza dough to rise.</p>

        <strong>Sugar</strong>
        <p>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon</p>
        <p>of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speed up the</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/how-to-proof-yeast/" target="_blank">activation process.</a> You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and</p>
        <p>frothy on top.</p>

        <strong>Bread Flour</strong>
        <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/difference-between-bread-flour-and-all-purpose-flour/" target="_blank">Bread flour</a> is ideal for pizza crust because it creates chewier result than all-</p>
        <p>purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots</p>
        <p>of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</p>

        <strong>Olive Oil</strong>
        <p>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes it to pizza crust: Not only</p>
        <p>does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and</p>
        <p>water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</p>

        <strong>Salt</strong>
        <p>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the</p>
        <p>gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation</p>
        <p>(resulting in a better rise).</p>

        <h2>How to Roll Out Pizza Dough</h2>
        <p>Stretching pizza dough is the most hands-on part of the pizza crust-</p>
        <p>making process. It takes a little practice, but it's as easy as pie (pun</p>
        <p>intended). To shape the dough:</p>

        <h3>Let the Dough come to Room Temperature</h3>
        <p>After you're finished mixing the ingredients, allow your dough to rest on</p>
        <p>the counter for about 30 minutes. This will allow the gluten to relax,</p>
        <p>making the dough much easier to stretch and shape. Cold dough is</p>
        <p>much more difficult to work with.</p>

        <h3>Prepare Your Surface With Oil</h3>
        <p>You might feel inclined to prep your workspace with a big handful of</p>
        <p>flour to prevent sticking. This is a helpful step with many kinds of dough.</p>
        <p>However, in this case, too much flour can make your pizza crust tough.</p>
        <p>Instead, rub your surface (and your hands) with a few tablespoons of</p>
        <p>olive oil and <em>maybe</em> a little bit of flour. This will prevent sticking,</p>
        <p>encourage a crispy texture, and ensure a gorgeous golden color.</p>

        <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>
        <p>You have a few options when it comes to shaping the dough. Stretch it in</p>
        <p>the air, use a rolling pin, or pat it with your hands. No matter wich</p>
        <p>method you choose, make sure not to overwork the dough. Working it</p>
        <p>too much will create a tough texture. When you're done, you should</p>
        <p>have an even circle that's about 10 to 12 inches wide and about ⅓-inch</p>
        <p>thick. If you get too thin, the crust may not be able to support the sauce</p>
        <p>and toppings.</p>

        <h2>How Long Does Pizza Dough Last In the Fridge?</h2>
        <p>This pizza dough will last for about five days in the fridge. Store it in an</p>
        <p>airtight storage container or a bowl tightly covered with storage warp.</p>
        <p>Allow the refrigerated dough to sit for about 30 minutes at romm</p>
        <p>temperature before using.</p>

        <h2>Can You Freeze Pizza Dough?</h2>
        <p>Yes! You Can absolutely freeze pizza dough. This is a great option for</p>
        <p>people who make pizza often. Prepare the dough for freezing by rolling</p>
        <p>it into a ball and lightly coating it with oil. Place the ball in a freezer-safe</p>
        <p>container labeled with the date. Freeze for about three months.</p>
        <br>
        <p>To thaw the dough, simply transfer it to the fridge the night before you</p>
        <p>plan to use it.</p>
